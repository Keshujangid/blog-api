# Blog API

## Overview
This project is a RESTful API built with **Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL** . It serves as the backend for a **blog platform** that will have two separate frontends:

1. A **public frontend** where users can read and comment on blog posts.
2. A **private admin frontend** where the author can create, edit, and publish blog posts.

This project is a great way to practice and see the benefits of creating an API-only backend, allowing multiple frontends to interact with it.

## Features
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user login and role-based access.
- **User Registration & Login** with validation.
- **CRUD Operations for Blog Posts** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **Comment System** with authentication for posting and managing comments.
- **Admin Controls** for managing posts and comments.
- **Middleware for Validation and Authentication**.
- **RESTful API Design** with structured endpoints.

## Installation
### **Prerequisites**
- Install **Node.js** and **npm**.
- Setup a **MongoDB/PostgreSQL database**.

### **Steps to Run Locally**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Keshujangid/Blog-api.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Blog-api

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables
PORT=5000
your_database_connection_string=your_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Start the server
npm start
```
The server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.
